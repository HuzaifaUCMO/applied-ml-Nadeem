# Lab 2 - Titanic Data Exploration and Splitting

## Overview
This lab focuses on exploring and preparing the Titanic dataset for Machine Learning tasks. We follow the general steps:
1. **Import and inspect** the dataset
2. **Explore** the data with visualizations
3. **Handle missing values** and possibly **engineer new features**
4. **Select** features and a **target**
5. **Split** the data (basic and stratified)

We use standard Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plotting
- `scikit-learn` for splitting and (later) modeling

## Files in this folder
- `README.md`: this file
- `ml02_yourname.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the analysis

## Instructions to Run
1. Open `ml02_yourname.ipynb` in Jupyter (or VS Code, or your favorite environment).
2. Run each cell from top to bottom.
3. Check for output, plots, and reflection text.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+ (or as specified by your instructor)
- The packages listed in the notebook: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
